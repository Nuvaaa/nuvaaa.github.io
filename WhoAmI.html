        <h1>Now let's get more in depth</h1>
        For most of my life, my gender never really felt "correct." Sure, nothing felt wrong, it just felt... off.
        That is until Christmas 2022 (or 2023 my memory sucks.) I got a purplish pink sweater, and I was cold so I put it on.
        I wore that sweater until I was about to lay down. I took off the sweater and saw my arm.
        I was suddenly incredibly aware of my body. My height, the hair, other things. It all felt wrong, and it hurt.<br><br>
        I had an identity crisis, and ended up crying myself to sleep that night.
        I realized that I had been masking and hiding from myself for years, and now nothing felt right anymore.
        I didn't want to stay like that, so I started thinking about myself more.
        Another breakdown a bit later made me realize I don't want to be referred to as a guy.
        That it hurt to be called he, sir, or even my own name.<br><br>
        From that point I started talking to my friends at the time about this stuff.
        They started referring to me using they/them and just used my online username.
        It felt nice, but something still felt a little off.
        Sure, this wasn’t wrong at all, but there was still something that needed to be found.
        Then there was that night my mind would just not stop thinking about things.
        The names I would think of for myself, the styles I like, the descriptors I enjoy, it all pointed in one direction.
        I opened my eyes and said quietly to myself, “I am a girl” and for once, it felt right!
        The most genuine smile I have ever had appeared on my face and it stuck until I eventually fell asleep.
        For once, I finally knew what a part of me was.<br><br>
        This was about a year and half ago as of typing this, and I continued to discover more about myself as time went on.
        I found I enjoy being referred to as They or She.
        Given my appearance I understand why calling me she would be difficult.
        I found the name that fits me is Anna.
        Turns out instead of finding the perfect name I just needed someone to refer to me as someone to call me one of those names.<br><br>
        Anytime I complain when someone calls me sir, or mention that I don’t like my name, this is why.
        This is why I had that random mini breakdown when a customer said “Put the man back on” when Val took over.
        These things hurt every time they happen, and it builds up a sick feeling in my throat over the course of the day.<br><br>
        So what am I exactly? I’m unable to really put it into words, so I just say my gender is Silly.
        Romantically, I think I get attracted to more feminine people that I know well, but I’m unsure if I can feel romantic attraction at all.<br><br>
        I think the reason I don't just say these things is because I’m scared of negative reactions, so I hide behind screens.
        I have only come out to one person face to face, and it was my best friend, who later helped me come out to my closest
        friend group by sending a pre-typed message I made when I was out of the room.
        To my parents I had to schedule a text for when we would all be asleep.
        I wish I could just say these things, but I’ve wanted to tell people since I started working, yet I’m stuck in the same place.<br><br>
        To whoever reading this, feel free to spread this information as much as you would like.
        Sorry if this infodump is large or gives too much info, but this is really the only way I know how to tell people.
        Talking is hard :[
